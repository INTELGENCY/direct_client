      "By accessing and utilizing the Smart Ball Based Surveillance System (BKV-1), users implicitly agree to the following terms and conditions. This system, integrating cutting-edge hardware and software, is exclusively intended for use by authorized law enforcement and security agencies. Users acknowledge the system's functionality for enhancing intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance missions, understanding that technological limitations may necessitate updates for optimization. Data security and privacy are paramount, and deploying agencies are responsible for adhering to legal and ethical standards. Operators maintain full control over the system's features, ensuring compliance with local laws. Users are advised to capture images when the ball is motionless to prevent blurriness. Wi-Fi connectivity and user interface accessibility are essential for seamless operation, with the deploying agency assuming all associated risks. Any future dedicated applications will be subject to additional terms. Modifications and updates may occur, and governing law is applicable to these terms and conditions. Violation may result in system access suspension and legal action.",
